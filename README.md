## Hello everyone! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### About Me

I'm Roger, a passionate data analyst who enjoys unraveling complexity and exploring possibilities. I have a keen interest in working with Big Data and harnessing its power. Currently, I'm working on my thesis in Demography and Planning, where I plan to utilize Machine Learning to project the age structure of a population. I'm excited to apply advanced techniques to gain insights and make future-oriented predictions.

### Learning Interests

My main focus lies in data analysis and leveraging Big Data. I'm eager to learn and master the tools and techniques required to work with massive datasets and extract valuable insights. I'm interested in exploring different methods of data analysis and visualization, as well as developing skills in Big Data technologies.

### Current Projects

I am currently dedicated to my thesis in Demography and Planning, where I apply my data analysis and Machine Learning knowledge to develop age structure projections for a population. Additionally, I am also working on personal projects related to exploratory data analysis and visualization to expand my skills and knowledge.

### Favorite Hobbies

When I'm not immersed in the world of data, I find solace in two hobbies that bring balance to my life. The first is the art of Bonsai, where I love spending time caring for and shaping these small, beautiful natural creations. The second is working out, which helps me stay fit and clear my mind.

### Connect with Me!

If you have any questions, suggestions, or simply want to chat about data analysis, Big Data, or any related topics, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always open to new connections and collaboration opportunities.
